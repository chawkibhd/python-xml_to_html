# python-xml_to_html
This project involves a Python script that takes an XML file containing structured data as input and generates an HTML file presenting this data in a user-friendly manner for end users. The Python script uses the xml.dom module to analyze and extract data from the XML file, and then utilizes HTML templates to build the final HTML file.
